# King of the Cards
The software is written in C# and Python.
- To run the C# part (client and server) for the game, install the necessary dependencies. You can run only the client with the "prod" run profile from your IDE if you like, as it is configured to use the production server located on kcapi.mecseki.net.
- To run the Python part (card counting software), use ```pip install``` with the requirements.txt file
